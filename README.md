# Blackjack: 21

## Objective of Game
* Player attempts to beat the Dealer by getting as close to 21, without going over 21. 
* If Player hits Blackjack: 21, Player automatically wins.  If Dealer hits Blackjack: 21, Dealer automatically wins.
* If Player and Dealer hit Blackjack 21, Player wins.

## 52 Card Pack Rule
* Standard 52 card deck

## Card Values
* Numeric cards are worth their shown value; ie the 9 of hearts is worth 9.
* Face cards are worth 10.
* Ace is worth 1 or 11, whatever the Player/Dealer chooses.

## Gameplay 
* Player and Dealer will be dealt 2 cards each.
* Player will be dealt first card while Dealer alternates deal of cards back and forth until 4 cards dealt.
* If Players dealt hand is 21 in 2 cards, then it is a natural Blackjack: 21. Player automatically wins. 
* If Dealers dealt hand is 21 in 2 cards, then it is a natural Blackjack: 21.  Dealer automatically wins.
* If Player and Dealer hand is 21 in 2 cards each, Player wins.  

## Post-Deal Gameplay
* Player goes first.  Player will decided to "Hit" or "Stand".  
* By selecting "Hit" player will receive a card attempting to get as close as possible or to hit the number 21. ie;
 (Player is dealt a 5 of clubs and a 4 of spades = 9.  Player should "Hit" to be dealt another card with the hopes of getting closer to 21.)

* If player cards add up to over 21 it is called a "Bust" and the Player loses.  Same rule applys to Dealer.   

* By selecting "Stand" Player will stay on the number they have been dealt. ie;
(In the above scenario 5 of clubs and 4 of spades, if the Player selects hit and is dealt a King, their hand would be 19.  This is a good hand and the player would then want to select "Stand".)

# Strategy
* Ace can be used as a 1 or an 11, as stated earlier.  If Player is dealt a hand such as an Ace of spade and 4 of hearts, this is a SOFT 15.  It is considered soft because Player hand could be a 5 or a 15.  While 15 is not considered a good hand, player could "Hit" in hopes of next card being a 6, for a total of 21!

 In the above example;

 If the player did not recieve a 6 and instead received a 7, they would normally "Bust" as their hand would equal 22.  Since they have an Ace, the Ace would represent 1, instead of 11, and their hand would be at 12.
